## Features

Life can have its moments of challenge. When you need a pick-me-up, come visit the Self Care Center. There, you can chose between inspiring mantras or affirmations to bring clarity and light to your day. 

Each time you select "Receive Message", you will have a randomized quote returned to you. When one appears that truly speaks to you, you made add it to a list of Favorites by selecting the "Add Your Favorite" button. 

When you've accumulated a list of favorite quotes, select the "View Favorites" button to navigate to your Saved Inspirations!

Should a quote no longer serve you with what you're looking for, simply click on the quote, it will change to a light yellow to confirm the selection, and then click on the "Delete Quote" button. *Voila!* At any time, you may also return to the Welcome Page by selecting the "Return" button.

We hope that this page will help to bring inspiration and joy to your day with helpful reminderes. Namaste!
